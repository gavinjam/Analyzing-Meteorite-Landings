    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p> This website displays the results of analyzing meteorite landings. Python 
        libraries was used to do a Numerical Analysis, Graphical Analysis, and as 
        well as train a ML model to predict the location of a meteorite landing.
        The data is from a Nasa's open source database of datasets. Click

    <h3>Motivation and Background</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding meteorite landings can help us understand how Earth and the Universe were created.
        Meteorites also contain precious materials that can tell the timeline of a meteorite in correlation to
        Earth. It has an economic bonus as well because we get to understand how these materials can be used
        and can help us find places to mine for resources when Earth’s metals become scarce. Some of these
        calculations can help us understand meteorites in the future and may help answer questions like how
        meteorites caused the extinction of dinosaurs. Also, Nasa’s visualizations currently for this dataset are
        not that great for the general public to understand and some of the current visualizations do not create
        graphs correctly.

    <h3>Research Questions</h3>
    <p>
        1. What is the most popular and most rare meteorite class that has landed on Earth and where
        specifically?        
        <br><br>
        2. What is the average mass, range of mass, the biggest mass, and smallest mass of meteorites
        that have landed on Earth?
        <br><br>
        3. Can we visually see where meteorites landed in different places of the world and analyze how
        big they were? 
        <br><br>
        4. Can we predict where a meteorite is most likely going to hit Earth based on the class type, mass,
        and year?
